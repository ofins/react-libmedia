# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-avplayer.git
cd react-avplayer
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
